## ✅Bootcamp NTT Data
### Introduction:
In this project, acting as a Data Scientist, I performed all the necessary steps to make predictions on a data set. The process involved everything from collecting/extracting data to creating prediction models using machine learning (ML). At the end of the project, I was able to determine the price of each release, gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for his team. Additionally, the project determines whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
